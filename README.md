Starfall is a medium-sized datapack that focuses on enriching Minecraft's nights by bringing an array of fun mechanics, items, and atmosphere. You'll notice a lot of inspiration from [Outer Wilds](https://www.mobiusdigitalgames.com/outer-wilds.html), [Animal Crossing](https://animalcrossing.nintendo.com/), [Terraria](https://terraria.org/) (and more!).

I hope you enjoy the pack and that it will leave a unique, impression on your world! Have fun!

**Note:** It is recommended that you play Starfall with Render & Simulation Distance set to 10 or above and Particles set to All.
