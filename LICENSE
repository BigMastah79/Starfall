A. Introduction

  This license describes how you, the user, may use Starfall and related assets. This license is subject to change by BigMastah, the owner, at any time.

B. Allowed Uses

  1. You may play with Starfall in any form on any singleplayer or multiplayer server you choose.

  2. You may edit Starfall and its assets for your own personal use, so long as you do not redistribute said edited content publicly. This does not apply to edited content that is sufficiently distinguishable as original and distinct from Starfall content and that does not break any of the rest of this license.

    For example:
    - You are allowed to create an edited version without all features you dislike for personal use. You are not allowed to redistribute it.
    - You are allowed to use a personal edited version on your own private or public server.
    - You are allowed to create a "Starfall but I remade every texture by hand in MS Paint" add-on pack and redistribute it.

  3. You may create and share your own Starfall-related content, such as videos, fanart, and images so long as you do not charge for said content and it does not redistribute Starfall or any of its assets.

    For example:
    - You are allowed to create a video series of your gameplay.
    - You are not allowed to create Starfall merchandise and charge for it.


C. Denied Uses

  1. You may not redistribute Starfall or any of its assets. This does not apply to simple mcfunction concepts. You are free to read Starfall code and use it to learn.

    i. You may not use any of our resource pack assets or models for your own projects.
      For example:
      - You are not allowed to take Starfall's Star Fragment texture and create your own wrench data pack using it.
      - You are not allowed to use Starfall's Outlander model for your own project.
      - You are not allowed to make Starfall NFTs.

    ii. You may not use Starfall's mcfunction code for your own projects. However, as noted above, this does not apply to simple, sufficiently generic mcfunction concepts.
      For example:
      - You may use simple concepts such as block placement or randomization techniques and use them in your own data pack.
      - You may not take all of the code for the Outlander and redistribute it in your own "wandering mob" data pack.

  2. You may not use Starfall in any public modpack, datapackpack, or any type of compilation without express permission from the owner, which may be revoked at any time.
    For example:
    - You may not create a public compilation titled "Better Vanilla" combination of vanilla+ datapacks and include Starfall without the owner's permission.
    - You may create your own private compilation and use it. (See B2)

  3. You may not pass off Starfall or its assets as your own. Give proper credit where it is due.
